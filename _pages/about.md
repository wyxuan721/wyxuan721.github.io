## Biography

Hi, I'm Yuxuan Wu (吴宇轩). I am currently a Master's student in Electronic Information at Southeast University. My research focuses on multimodal human–computer interaction, with particular interest in speech processing, large language models, and assistive technologies.

I received my B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hohai University in 2024, and also obtained the Licence degree in Mechanical Engineering from Université de Lille through a joint program. In addition, I pursued a Master of Science in Health Science at Monash University.

My recent work explores LLM-based speech conversion systems for dysarthric speech, aiming to improve accessibility and real-time human–machine communication. My research involves integrating automatic speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) into unified multimodal systems.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or collaboration opportunities.
